# 🧠 TEDxKashere Official Website

The official website for **TEDxKashere**, independently developed to promote their TEDx event. This project was built from scratch using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS Modules**, without a provided design file. Instead, the design was carefully crafted by referencing other TEDx websites and following official **TEDx branding guidelines**.
